# JPF
JavaScript Presentation Foundation - a very simple didactic JavaScript project to demonstrate how to implement UI data bindings :)

To see it in - aehm - action, just run the index.html in a browser. The code comes with an associated Visual Studio Web Site project.

There are plenty of popular and more or less giant JavaScript frameworks for building modern and dynamic web applications.
So, what's the purpose of JPF? Well, this project is just for myself to experiment with JavaScript while doing one of things I like most: writing a library!!!
The bottom line is I am not planning to implement anything which is technically or semantically perfect, nor I am planning to turn it into a one of the frameworks mentioned above.

It's just a Presentation Foundation (...ihih...)
